# biovarTrieste

The 19 bioclimatic variables for the city of Trieste in tif format at 100m x 100m resolution.\
Raw data for the city of Trieste was obtained from [copernicus.ue](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/sis-urban-climate-cities?tab=form)\
Bioclimatic variables are computed following the workflow proposed by [Vega C.G. et al. (2017)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2018.70) using minimum specific humidity as proxy for precipitations
