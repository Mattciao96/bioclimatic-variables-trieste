Raw data for the city of Trieste are obtained from [copernicus.ue](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/sis-urban-climate-cities?tab=form)  
Bioclimatic variables are computed following the workflow proposed by [Vega C.G. et al. (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2017.78) using minimum specific humidity as a proxy for precipitation.
